# GUH-2023

Welcome to "WebWhimsy: A Symphony of Chaos", a quirky and entertaining web development challenge that defies convention and celebrates the absurd.

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, the ordinary has no place, and absurdity reigns supreme. Your mission is to create a website that intentionally defies every rule of design, navigation, and functionality, all in the name of amusement. Let your imagination run wild, embrace the unconventional, and craft a website that's so wonderfully ludicrous, it's unforgettable.

The goal is not to create a website with random irritating bugs but to design a fun and confusing user experience intentionally. Remember, it's still a website, so it shouldn't just be a collection of 404 errors! We encourage you to push the limits of conventional web design. In this challenge, there is no such thing as Ben Schneiderman's 8 Golden Rules... or is there?

## Challenge Highlights

- Four stages of annoying challenges.
- A final bonus round to test your limits.
- Unconventional, absurd, and unforgettable web design.
- Embrace the unconventional and push the boundaries.
- Team name: "The 3 Musketeers."
